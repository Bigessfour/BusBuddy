# BusBuddy Blazor Implementation Notes

## Changes Made to Fix Build Issues

1. **Test Project Configuration**
   - Updated test project file to properly configure package references
   - Added explicit imports for EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory to test files
   - Created a TestUsings.cs helper file to ensure proper InMemory database support

2. **Docker Implementation**
   - Updated the main Dockerfile to support both application and test scenarios
   - Created a separate Dockerfile.tests with focused test execution capabilities
   - Enhanced docker-compose.tests.yml to properly set up the test environment
   - Added PowerShell scripts for easier test execution in Docker

3. **Build Fixes**
   - Created helper scripts to address common build issues
   - Added workarounds for the EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory reference problems
   - Ensured consistent SDK version through global.json

## Running the Application

### Development Environment
```powershell
# Run in development mode
./dev-startup.cmd
```

### Running in Docker
```powershell
# Run the Blazor application in Docker
docker-compose up
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory Reference Issues**
   - If you encounter "UseInMemoryDatabase not found" errors, run the Fix-BuildIssues.ps1 script
   - Alternatively, add `using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory;` to affected test files

2. **Windows Forms in Blazor Context**
   - The project is transitioning from a mixed Windows Forms/Blazor to pure Blazor
   - Some Windows-specific code may still exist and generate CA1416 warnings
   - These warnings are non-critical and will be resolved as the migration progresses

3. **DTO Mismatches**
   - Some components expect DashboardMetricsDto but are receiving DashboardDto
   - This is part of the transition and will need to be addressed in a separate task
