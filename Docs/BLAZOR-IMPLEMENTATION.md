# BusBuddy Blazor Implementation Guide

## Project Direction

BusBuddy has been transitioned from a mixed Windows Forms/Blazor application to a pure Blazor-based web application. This guide outlines the implementation details and provides steps for working with the new Blazor-focused version.

## Architecture Overview

The new architecture focuses on:

1. **Blazor Server** as the primary UI technology
2. **SQL Server Express** for database storage
3. **Docker** for development, testing, and deployment

## Migration Status

### Completed:
- âœ… Removed Windows Forms dependencies from Program.cs
- âœ… Updated WebStartup.cs to focus on Blazor
- âœ… Updated Docker configuration for pure Blazor development
- âœ… Created migration helper scripts
- âœ… Updated documentation

### In Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Phasing out remaining Windows Forms code
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing test coverage for Blazor components
- ðŸ”„ Updating CI/CD pipelines for Blazor-only builds

## Key Components

### 1. Blazor Components
- Located in `/Pages` and `/Components` directories
- Main dashboard in `Pages/Dashboard.razor`
- Modern dashboard alternative in `Pages/ModernDashboard.razor`
- Shared components in `Components/` directory

### 2. Data Access
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- Database context in `Data/BusBuddyContext.cs`
- Migration scripts in `Migrations/` directory

### 3. Services
- Dashboard services in `Services/Dashboard/`
- API controllers in `Controllers/` directory
- SignalR hubs in `Hubs/` directory

## Docker Implementation

### Development Environment
The development environment uses Docker Compose to run:
- SQL Server Express container
- Blazor application with hot reload

### Running the Application
1. Use the provided script: `.\Start-BlazorDocker.ps1`
2. Access the application at http://localhost:5000

### Configuration
- Connection strings are configured in `appsettings.json`
- Docker environment variables override these settings when running in containers

## Migration Helper

A helper script has been created to assist with migration:
```powershell
.\Migrate-ToBlazor.ps1 [-Clean] [-NoBuild] [-RunDocker]
```

Options:
- `-Clean`: Remove build artifacts before migration
- `-NoBuild`: Skip building the application
- `-RunDocker`: Run the application in Docker after migration

## Testing

### Blazor-Specific Tests
- Tests in `/Tests/DashboardBlazorTests.cs` specifically target Blazor components
- Integration tests in `DashboardStartupTests.cs` verify the full Blazor stack

### Running Tests in Docker
1. Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.tests.yml up`

## Next Steps

1. Complete removal of any remaining Windows Forms references
2. Enhance test coverage for Blazor components
3. Implement additional Blazor features (authentication, admin panels)
4. Optimize the Blazor application for performance
5. Create deployment pipeline for production
